# Anno 117: Pax Romana — CrossOver fix installer
# Copies the swapchain-fix shim into the game and enables the required
# Wine DLL overrides. Safe to re-run (e.g. after a game update).
#
# Works for BOTH stores: Steam and Ubisoft Connect running directly in
# CrossOver. Steam doesn't run the game itself — it just launches Ubisoft
# Connect, which launches the game — so the patch is identical; only the game
# folder's location differs. The DLLs always go in the same game-relative spot:
# <game>/Bin/Win64/ next to Anno117.exe.
#
# By default the installer is interactive: it lists your CrossOver bottles, you
# pick the one the game is in, it locates the game (Steam or Ubisoft layout),
# shows you what it found, and asks you to confirm before touching anything.
#
# Non-interactive overrides (for automation / re-runs):
#   ANNO_BOTTLE="Name"      skip the menu, use this bottle
#   ANNO_GAME_DIR="/path"   skip detection, use this Bin/Win64 folder
#   ANNO_YES=1              skip the confirmation prompt
