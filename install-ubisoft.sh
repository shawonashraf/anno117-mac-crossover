# Anno 117: Pax Romana — CrossOver fix installer (Ubisoft Connect edition)
#
# Same swapchain-fix shim as install.sh, but tailored to a direct Ubisoft
# Connect install running in CrossOver:
#   * bottle defaults to "Ubisoft Connect"
#   * detects the game in the Ubisoft Game Launcher layout (x86 / x64 / custom)
#   * sets the Wine DLL overrides for BOTH Anno117.exe and Anno117_plus.exe
#     (the Ubisoft build ships the _plus variant; both import amd_ags_x64.dll,
#     so both need the overrides — the generic installer only covers the base
#     exe, which is why the Ubisoft copy shipped the shim but still crashed)
#   * does NOT suppress `reg` errors: a silently-failed override write leaves
#     the DLLs copied but the fix inactive, which looks exactly like "doesn't
#     work" (the original Ubisoft bug)
#
# Safe to re-run (e.g. after a game update or "Verify files" in Ubisoft Connect).
#
# Non-interactive overrides (for automation / re-runs):
#   ANNO_BOTTLE="Name"      skip the menu, use this bottle
#   ANNO_GAME_DIR="/path"   skip detection, use this Bin/Win64 folder
#   ANNO_YES=1              skip the confirmation prompt
